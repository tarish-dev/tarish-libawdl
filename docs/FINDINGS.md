# Findings

Each entry names the capture it came from. A claim with no capture behind it says so.

## 1. The parser agrees with Wireshark, frame for frame and tag for tag

`captures/awdl-149.pcap` — 45s, channel 149, Raspberry Pi 400 + ALFA AWUS036ACM (`mt76x2u`).

|  | marsad | `tshark -Y awdl` |
|---|---|---|
| frames in capture | 6584 | 6584 |
| identified as AWDL | **278** | **278** |

The TLV histogram is identical too, tag for tag:

```
 154 [ 0] SSTH Request           278 [12] Data Path State
 576 [ 2] Service Response       192 [16] Arpa
 278 [ 4] Sync Parameters        278 [17] IEEE 802.11 Container
 278 [ 5] Election Parameters    278 [18] Channel Sequence
 278 [ 6] Service Parameters     278 [21] Version
 278 [ 7] HT Capabilities        278 [24] Election Parameters v2
                                 184 [32] undocumented
                                 184 [33] undocumented
```

This matters more than it looks. Independent agreement on **which 278 of 6584 frames are
AWDL** is what makes every later measurement worth reporting. Without it, a parser that
quietly drops a frame class produces clean, confident, wrong numbers.

## 2. Tags 32 and 33 are on the wire and in no published table

Wireshark's enum ends at 24 (`AWDL_ELECTION_PARAMETERS_V2_TLV`). Tags **32** and **33**
appear 184 times each in 45 seconds, in MIFs from current Apple devices. `tshark
-e awdl.tag.number` reports them too, so this is not our parser inventing them — it is
Wireshark having no name for them.

Contents undecoded. Two tags appearing at identical counts, in the same frames, is the
sort of pairing that usually means a capability/operation pair (as 7/8 are), but that is
a guess and is flagged as one.

The 2018 paper does not describe them. This is the first concrete instance of the drift
the research brief warned about: **do not assume the paper still describes what Apple
ships.**

## 3. AWDL is in the air with nobody touching anything

Nobody opened a share sheet during this capture. Three Apple devices were nonetheless
sending AWDL continuously:

```
06:37:6f:45:5c:68    94 frames
1a:90:37:31:e6:58   107 frames
ee:4b:4f:cc:5b:12    77 frames
```

269 MIF to 9 PSF. So Master Indication Frames are the steady state, not an artefact of an
active transfer, and a passive listener sees a device's full parameter set — channel
sequence, election state, services — without any interaction at all.

Useful consequence: **channel 149 is already the right place to listen in this region**,
and no Apple device needs to be doing anything for the experiment to run.

## 4. Every AWDL sender uses a randomised MAC

All three senders have the locally-administered bit set (`0x02` in the first octet):
`06:`, `1a:`, `ee:`. There is no hardware address to key on. Anything that identifies a
peer by MAC will work on a bench, where addresses happen to be stable for a while, and
fail in the field. Asserted in `crates/awdl/tests/real_capture.rs` so it cannot be
forgotten.

## 5. Half the air is ACKs, which is not the same as unparseable

The first version of `marsad stats` reported 3158 of 6584 frames "unparsed", which looked
alarming and was an artefact: it demanded a full 24-byte management header before it
would say what a frame was, and a control frame is ten bytes with no third address.

Corrected breakdown of the same capture:

```
6584 frames: 278 AWDL, 6306 other 802.11, 0 not 802.11
  other control      6287
  other management     19
```

Zero unaccounted for. The lesson is worth keeping: a classifier that cannot distinguish
"too short for the header I wanted" from "not 802.11" will make a healthy capture look
broken.

## 6. The paper's timing claims hold on 2026 devices — and there is more in the frame than it describes

`captures/awdl-149.pcap`, all 278 AWDL frames. Cross-checked against `tshark -V`.

| Claim (Stute et al., 2018) | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Availability Window is 16 TU | **confirmed** | `aw_period = 16` in 278/278 frames; 16 x 1024 = 16384 us |
| Channel sequence has 16 slots | **confirmed** | count field is 15, and the count is stored **minus one** |
| Social channels 6 / 44 / 149 | **confirmed for this region** | only 6 and 149 in use; 44 never appears, consistent with Qatar mapping to 149 |

### A frame carries its schedule TWICE, in two different encodings

This is not in the paper and is the kind of thing that makes an implementation subtly
wrong rather than broken. **Synchronization Parameters (tag 4) embeds a complete channel
sequence of its own**, in addition to the standalone Channel Sequence (tag 18). In the
same frame:

```
tag 4  (Legacy encoding)    0, 0, 151, 0, 0, 151, 0, 0, 6, 0, 151, 0, 0, 151, 0, 0
tag 18 (OpClass encoding)   0, 0, 149, 0, 0, 149, 0, 0, 6, 0, 149, 0, 0, 149, 0, 0
```

Identical occupancy, different channel numbers: **151 is the 40 MHz centre, 149 and 153
are its 20 MHz halves.** The two encodings also order their bytes differently — Legacy is
`flags, channel`, OpClass is `channel, opclass` — so reading one as the other produces
plausible garbage rather than an error.

Occupancy matched slot-for-slot across the whole capture (3/16, 4/16, 5/16, 6/16 and 9/16,
with identical frame counts on both), which is what establishes they describe one schedule
rather than two.

### A device is absent for most of its own schedule

Occupancy ranged from **3 of 16 slots to 9 of 16**. Channel 0 means "not present", and
most slots are 0.

This is the number that governs throughput between two peers, and it is not the link rate.
Two nodes can only exchange anything during windows where **both** are present **and** on
the same channel. A peer at 3/16 imposes a hard ceiling of 18% of airtime on anyone
talking to it, however fast the modulation.

It also explains the earlier iPhone measurement from the Android work — 4 of 16 slots
split across 149 and 6, against our own devices at 16/16 on one channel, giving roughly
19% overlap and 2.6-4.7 MB/s. That figure was previously attributed to the radio. It is
the schedule.

### `AP Beacon alignment delta` exists

A named field in Synchronization Parameters, immediately after the AW sequence number.
**There is no reason to carry an access point's beacon offset unless you intend to line
up with it**, which is direct evidence that AWDL is designed to time-share with an
infrastructure association rather than merely tolerate one — the question the research
brief flags as highest value.

It was **0 in all 278 frames**, consistent with these particular devices not currently
time-sharing with an AP. That is a measurement to repeat against a device that
demonstrably is, and until then the field's existence is the finding, not its value.

**What this does NOT yet show.** Channel 153 appears in some sequences alongside 149, and
there is an AP on 153 nearby, so it is tempting to read that as the AP's channel appearing
in the slots. It is more likely the other half of the 149+153 bond centred on 151 — the
Legacy sequence reports 151 in exactly those slots. Not claimed either way.

## Setup, and the one trap in it

`~/awdl-up.sh` on the Pi. Three things that do not survive a reboot and one that is not
stable at all:

- **rfkill soft-blocks every radio** until a country is set. `ip link set ... up` then
  fails with `Operation not possible due to RF-kill`.
- **The regulatory domain reverts to `country 00`**, which marks all of 5 GHz
  `PASSIVE-SCAN`/no-IR — the radio may listen on 44 and 149 but not transmit.
- **The phy index moves.** It was `phy2` before a reboot and `phy1` after. A hardcoded
  index fails with `No such device (-19)`, which reads like the adapter is missing.
- **The managed interface on the same phy must be DOWN.** This is the one that costs
  real time, because it fails as a success: OWL reports `Channel 44 is available for
  frame injection`, creates `awdl0`, and then every `send()` returns `EAGAIN` with
  nothing in `dmesg`. The adapter is fine — `aireplay-ng -9` gets 30/30 on the same
  radio at the same moment. `mt76` will not transmit from a monitor vif while another
  vif on the phy is up, and will not let you set the channel either. Flipping the
  primary interface to `type monitor` fails identically.
