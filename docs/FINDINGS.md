# Findings

Each entry names the capture it came from. A claim with no capture behind it says so.

## 1. The parser agrees with Wireshark, frame for frame and tag for tag

`captures/awdl-149.pcap` — 45s, channel 149, Raspberry Pi 400 + ALFA AWUS036ACM (`mt76x2u`).

|  | marsad | `tshark -Y awdl` |
|---|---|---|
| frames in capture | 6584 | 6584 |
| identified as AWDL | **278** | **278** |

The TLV histogram is identical too, tag for tag:

```
 154 [ 0] SSTH Request           278 [12] Data Path State
 576 [ 2] Service Response       192 [16] Arpa
 278 [ 4] Sync Parameters        278 [17] IEEE 802.11 Container
 278 [ 5] Election Parameters    278 [18] Channel Sequence
 278 [ 6] Service Parameters     278 [21] Version
 278 [ 7] HT Capabilities        278 [24] Election Parameters v2
                                 184 [32] undocumented
                                 184 [33] undocumented
```

This matters more than it looks. Independent agreement on **which 278 of 6584 frames are
AWDL** is what makes every later measurement worth reporting. Without it, a parser that
quietly drops a frame class produces clean, confident, wrong numbers.

## 2. Tags 32 and 33 are on the wire and in no published table

Wireshark's enum ends at 24 (`AWDL_ELECTION_PARAMETERS_V2_TLV`). Tags **32** and **33**
appear 184 times each in 45 seconds, in MIFs from current Apple devices. `tshark
-e awdl.tag.number` reports them too, so this is not our parser inventing them — it is
Wireshark having no name for them.

Contents undecoded. Two tags appearing at identical counts, in the same frames, is the
sort of pairing that usually means a capability/operation pair (as 7/8 are), but that is
a guess and is flagged as one.

The 2018 paper does not describe them. This is the first concrete instance of the drift
the research brief warned about: **do not assume the paper still describes what Apple
ships.**

## 3. AWDL is in the air with nobody touching anything

Nobody opened a share sheet during this capture. Three Apple devices were nonetheless
sending AWDL continuously:

```
06:37:6f:45:5c:68    94 frames
1a:90:37:31:e6:58   107 frames
ee:4b:4f:cc:5b:12    77 frames
```

269 MIF to 9 PSF. So Master Indication Frames are the steady state, not an artefact of an
active transfer, and a passive listener sees a device's full parameter set — channel
sequence, election state, services — without any interaction at all.

Useful consequence: **channel 149 is already the right place to listen in this region**,
and no Apple device needs to be doing anything for the experiment to run.

## 4. Every AWDL sender uses a randomised MAC

All three senders have the locally-administered bit set (`0x02` in the first octet):
`06:`, `1a:`, `ee:`. There is no hardware address to key on. Anything that identifies a
peer by MAC will work on a bench, where addresses happen to be stable for a while, and
fail in the field. Asserted in `crates/awdl/tests/real_capture.rs` so it cannot be
forgotten.

## 5. Half the air is ACKs, which is not the same as unparseable

The first version of `marsad stats` reported 3158 of 6584 frames "unparsed", which looked
alarming and was an artefact: it demanded a full 24-byte management header before it
would say what a frame was, and a control frame is ten bytes with no third address.

Corrected breakdown of the same capture:

```
6584 frames: 278 AWDL, 6306 other 802.11, 0 not 802.11
  other control      6287
  other management     19
```

Zero unaccounted for. The lesson is worth keeping: a classifier that cannot distinguish
"too short for the header I wanted" from "not 802.11" will make a healthy capture look
broken.

## Setup, and the one trap in it

`~/awdl-up.sh` on the Pi. Three things that do not survive a reboot and one that is not
stable at all:

- **rfkill soft-blocks every radio** until a country is set. `ip link set ... up` then
  fails with `Operation not possible due to RF-kill`.
- **The regulatory domain reverts to `country 00`**, which marks all of 5 GHz
  `PASSIVE-SCAN`/no-IR — the radio may listen on 44 and 149 but not transmit.
- **The phy index moves.** It was `phy2` before a reboot and `phy1` after. A hardcoded
  index fails with `No such device (-19)`, which reads like the adapter is missing.
- **The managed interface on the same phy must be DOWN.** This is the one that costs
  real time, because it fails as a success: OWL reports `Channel 44 is available for
  frame injection`, creates `awdl0`, and then every `send()` returns `EAGAIN` with
  nothing in `dmesg`. The adapter is fine — `aireplay-ng -9` gets 30/30 on the same
  radio at the same moment. `mt76` will not transmit from a monitor vif while another
  vif on the phy is up, and will not let you set the channel either. Flipping the
  primary interface to `type monitor` fails identically.
